Buildingct the tar ball.
 - Extract the tar ball.
 - Change to the fidofinder/trunk directory.
 - Edit the build.xml file to fit your installation. At the minimum you may
   want to change the scala.home property to point to your scala installtion
   and install.dir to point to where you want to install doom.  It is easiest
   to use the same directory that you installed ninthdrug.
 - Invoke ant.
 - Invoke ant install.

Configuring:
   The installation adds the path to the main doom configuration to your $HOME/.ninthdrug file.
   That should be ${install.dir}/conf/fidofinder.conf.  Edit this as you see fit.

   The doom database can be created by running the create_fido_db.sh script.  
   You will need sudo rights to the postgres user for this step.
   - create_fido_db.sh


Edit the fidofinder.conf file to set the correct user and password for the fido database.

Code Generator:

Is written for Postgres.
- Create a user and a database for that user
- Edit create_tables.sh

- Use this command to generate a db.description file
psql fido fido -h localhost < describe_fido.sql > db.description
- Edit the daogenerator.conf
- Run the daogenerator.sh <tablename> for each table
- Publish code to src directory with publishdaocode.sh


Defaults:

taak-app database
  -tasks table

  each table should have
  -id Int
  -active Boolean
